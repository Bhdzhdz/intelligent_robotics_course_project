<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="problem-description">Problem description</h2>
<p>The task is to create a 3D map of a simple environment using a mobile
robot and computer vision techniques. To do this, the robot will need to
navigate through the environment, avoid obstacles, decide which area of
the environment is yet to be explored and then move to it.</p>
<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The project aims to develop a proof of concept of what could be done
with a mobile robot and computer vision techniques, as well as create a
workflow to ease the creation of future similar projects of the students
of the Computer Science Department of the Autonomous University of San
Luis Potosí.</p>

<h2 id="task-description">Task description</h2>
<p>The robot will need to navigate through the environment, avoid
obstacles, decide which area of the environment is yet to be explored
and then move to it. Using a Kinect, the robot will be able to detect
the presence of obstacles and walls, saving the information to create a
map of the environment. The robot will stop the exploration when it as
no way to move towards the unexplored area, this could be because the
robot has mapped the whole environment or because there is no way to
move path wide enough to reach the unexplored area.</p>
<h2 id="environment-description">Environment description</h2>
<p>The environment that the robot must map consists of a 3x3 meter space
with box-like obstacles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Wall: A wall is a rectangular area of the environment that is not
traversable, it defines the boundaries of 3x3 meter space. To create a
wall we will use the plywood sheet available in the lab or the cardboard
boxes we can gather. The approximate dimensions of the walls should be
3mx1mx1cm.</p></li>
<li><p>Obstacle: An obstacle is a rectangular area of the environment
that is not traversable, To create an obstacle we will use the cardboard
boxes we can gather. All three dimensions of the obstacles should be
between 20 cm and 40 cm.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sensors">Sensors</h3>
<p>The robot will have a camera that will be used to detect the
obstacles in the environment and the creation of the map of the
environment.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the robot could use some other kind of sensors to
detect the obstacles in the environment, like infrared sensors and
bumpers integrated in the robot.</p>
<h3 id="actuators">Actuators</h3>
<p>The robot won’t need to grasp any objects, the only interaction with
the environment will navigation trough the environment.</p>

<!-- Robot Architecture: This section must contain the following subsections, and it should be

<ul>
<li><p>Collide: Receives a collision message from the Roomba bumper
sensor, and sends a message to the Robot to stop moving.</p></li>
<li><p>Feel force: Receives a force message from the Roomba’s infrared
sensors and the Kinect’s depth sensor, using this info the Roomba will
detect what direction will get it away from the walls.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid: Determine if a wall is too close. Uses the map and
environment information.</p></li>
<li><p>Wall/obstacle detection: Using the cloud point generate planes to
represent walls and obstacles.</p></li>
<li><p>Map update: Add new detected wall and obstacles to the 3D
map.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtual position correction: Using odometry techniques and
landmarks gathered from the camera, correct the virtual position to
better represent the real position of the robot.</p></li>
<li><p>Find path to unexplored: Find the closest unexplored reachable
position.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct towards unexplored: Calculate the necessary moves to the
reach the next position to explore.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate safe direction: Using the info from the “Direct towards
unexplored” and “Avoid” modules determine the value the motors need to
have.</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- Experiments and Results: This section should contain a description of the experiments
and results of the robot trying to solve the task, along with the problems found so far. This

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>There is only a small error, and it is somewhat constant among all
distances, this is error is probably caused from a combination of the
start and stop of the movement form the motors and human error during
the measurent.</p>
