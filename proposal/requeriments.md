* Name of the project
* Task description: Describe what is the task your robot is going to solve.
* Environment description: Describe the environment where your robot is going to be situated. This must include all types of obstacles or features within the environment. Add
an image (drawn by hand or in the computer) of the environment.
* Robot description: Describe the robot in terms of:
    * Robot: What robot are you planning to use (LEGO, Roomba, NAO)?
    * Sensors: What type of sensors are you planning to use and what for? (depending on the robot you choose)
    * Actuators: If the robot will have to grasp or take objects, describe the mechanisms that you are planning to use.
    * Movement: Describe the type of mechanism that you will use to move around the environment.
    * Behaviors: Describe all the different behaviors that (so far) you think your robot would need to accomplish the task.
    * Architecture: Define the architecture (as a block diagram) that you think it could be used for solving the task. The modules and the overall architecture might end up differently, but it is important to have something in mind from the start.
* Problems: Make a list of all possible problems you might run into while developing this project. You may separate them using the same points above.
