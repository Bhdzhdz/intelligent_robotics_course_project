# Introduction

## Problem description

The task is to create a 3D map of a simple environment using a mobile robot and computer vision techniques. To do this, the robot will need to navigate through the environment, avoid obstacles, decide which area of the environment is yet to be explored and then move to it.

## Goal

The project aims to develop a proof of concept of what could be done with a mobile robot and computer vision techniques, as well as create a workflow to ease the creation of future similar projects of the students of the Computer Science Department of the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosí.
